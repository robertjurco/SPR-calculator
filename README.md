 SPR Biosensor Simulation and Analysis Tool

This **Python-based simulation tool** is designed for researchers and engineers working on **Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) biosensors**. It enables the precise modeling and visualization of SPR response curves for multi-layered optical systems. By providing flexible configuration for material properties, layer thicknesses, and incident light characteristics, this tool empowers users to design, optimize, and analyze SPR-based sensors for various applications, such as biomolecular detection, chemical sensing, and environmental monitoring.

## Features

1. **Multi-Layer Reflectance and SPR Response Computation**:
   - Simulates the SPR response by modeling multilayer structures using complex refractive indices.
   - Supports both **Transverse Electric (TE)** and **Transverse Magnetic (TM)** polarizations, with an emphasis on **TM-mode**, the key for SPR detection.
   - Calculates reflection coefficients for customizable layer stacks, including buffers, substrate materials, and analytes.

2. **Support for Surface Plasmon Resonance Biosensors**:
   - Tunable parameters for designing biosensors, including **material refractive indices**, **analyte refractive index**, **layer thicknesses**, and more.
   - Calculates changes in SPR reflectance as a function of:
     - **Angle of incidence.**
     - **Wavelength of incident light.**
     - **Refractive index of analytes or surrounding media** for sensitivity studies.

3. **Visualization Tools**:
   - Generates high-resolution **intensity maps and SPR response graphs** to provide insights into sensor performance.
   - Visualizes sensitivity parameters, including:
     - **Angle vs. Wavelength Reflectance**.
     - **Wavelength vs. Layer Thickness**.
     - **Wavelength vs. Refractive Index**.

4. **Material-Based Customization**:
   - Leverages a refractive index module (`materials.material`) to retrieve optical constants for metals like gold (Au), titanium (Ti), and others commonly used in SPR biosensors.
   - Supports **Drude-Lorentz model fitting** for precise optical constant representations.
   - Easily customizable to add new material databases or parameters.

## How It Works

### Core Algorithm
The simulation calculates multilayer reflectance and intensity using the **transfer matrix method (TMM)**. Reflectance/intensity outputs are computed for customizable parameter ranges such as wavelength, thickness, angle, and analyte refractive index.

### Simulation Flow
1. Define the layer structure: substrate, gold layer, buffer, and analyte.
2. Set customizable optical properties for each layer: refractive index, thickness, and more.
3. Provide incident light properties (e.g., wavelength or angular spectra).
4. Simulate the reflectance or intensity and analyze the results through intuitive visualizations.

### Visualization
- High-resolution **heatmaps** to evaluate SPR characteristics and optimize biosensor design:
  - **Angle vs. Wavelength Reflectance**: Explore resonance angle shifts under different conditions.
  - **Wavelength vs. Layer Thickness**: Study the effect of varying material thickness on response.
  - **Wavelength vs. Refractive Index**: Analyze the SPR sensitivity to surrounding analyte refractive indices.
